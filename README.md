## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Some of my favorite apps are the social apps. They are well built and well maintained. One of them would be instagram, instagram has a very seamless app design where if you swipe left you are brought to their story function where you can make a story post or use the camera to create a post. Swiping right brings you to the direct messages tab. In the messages tab you can also swipe left or right to delete messages or mark them as read.

Another app that I am very fond of is snapchat. It opens up with the camera front and center and it does not stutter wben it does that. another thing that I like about it is the function where you can tell if someone has read your message or someone has'nt read your message yet. The messages are auto deleted after it is read which gives people more privacy but I think it is also an intelligent deisng. swiping right from the home screen brings you to people's stories and it is also done very smoothly. 

Tiktok is one of the biggest apps. And there is reason that it is since it is a very well designed app that is very seamless does not stutter and very suer friendly. One of the coolest feature from it in my opinion is the ability for it to adjust to the person's interests and gives you more similar videos to show the user. Swiping right gives you a more personalized feed since it is for people you follow and videoes they post. swiping right brings you to messages just like instagram. I like the smoothness of scrolling to the next video and playing them wihtout loading which gives a seamless experience to the users.

## App idea
An app idea that I have as an app that would recommend you movies that you might like based on your watch history from all the streaming services like netflix, hulu, amazon, or disney plus and many more. You would be able to swipe left and right and each swipe gives you a new movie and it would look like floating posters of movies where you can slightly see the ones on the left and the right but not enough to be able to tell what movie is next. You can also add movies that you have watched manually and it would be entered by clicking the plus sign on the top right and the app would adjust your movies suggestions based on that and your other streaming services. When clicking on the movies itself the poster would flip and on the other side you will have buttons where it'll show you where you can stream it or rent it and it will take you to that website and records that you have watched that movie and adjusts your suggestions again.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the challenges that I have encountered was looking for the assistant that was mentioned in the instructions but after going back and looking at the parts of the software I figured out where to find the assistant to be able to complete the prework.
